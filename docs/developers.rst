Please include

* your operating system and package version,
* any details about your local setup that might be helpful, and
* steps to reproduce the bug.

is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any issue tagged with ``enhancement`` and ``help wanted`` is open to whoever
wants to implement it.

Write documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lazyscribe`` can `always` use more documentation. If you are writing docstrings,
please make sure to run our QA tools before submitting a PR:

.. code-block:: python

    python -m pip install -e .[qa]
    python -m black lazyscribe
    python -m flake8 lazyscribe
    python -m pydocstyle --convention=numpy

If you're writing sphinx documentation, make sure to build the docs locally and preview
them before submitting a PR:

.. code-block:: python

    python -m pip install -e .[docs]
    make docs
    cd docs/
    python -m http.server

Submit feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is by opening an issue. If you are proposing a feature,

* explain it in detail,
* keep the scope narrow, and
* remember that this project is volunteer-driven, contributions are welcome!

    $ mamba create -n lazyscribe python=3.8 -y
    $ conda activate lazyscribe
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -e .[dev]

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-branch

#. When you're done making changes, run the QA tooling and tests::

    $ python -m black lazyscribe
    $ python -m flake8 lazyscribe
    $ python -m mypy lazyscribe
    $ python -m pydocstyle --convention=numpy lazyscribe
    $ python -m pytest tests --cov=lazyscribe --cov-report=term-missing

#. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::
